## About Me

I'm a Quantitative Modelling specialist, passionate about Risk Modelling and Management.


## My Projects

#### Risk Modelling and Management Projects

- [Credit Risk Modelling:](https://github.com/ekdonald/Credit-Risk-with-GLMs-Scorecards.git): Development of scorecards (Forward Looking): Probability of Default, Loss Given Default (LGD), Exposure at Default (EAD).
  
- [Risk modeling](https://github.com/ekdonald/Credit-Risk-Modelling.git): Credit Risk Modelling and Management with Machine Learning (e.g. Random Forests, XGBoost). Analyzing data and providing insights into various types of risks within a dataset..

#### Scientific projects

- [Dark Matter and Reheating Tools](https://github.com/ekdonald/DMandReheatingTools.git): A python package for studying all scenarios of reheating in the early universe with decaying/scattering inflaton and evaporating black hole. Also, allows compute the relic abundance of dark matter produced by the evaporating PBH. Inflaton decays into Standard Model only. 

- [Reheating Tools](https://github.com/ekdonald/ReheatingPyTools.git): A python package providing the solution of the Friedmann - Boltzmann equations for Primordial Black Holes + Inflaton + SM radiation + BSM Models. Allows to study different reheating scenarios in the universe post stochastic inflation and pre radiation domination. 

- [Superpy for munuSSM](https://github.com/ekdonald/Superpy4munuSSM.git): Bayesian Sampling, for exploring regions of susy mathematical models' parameter spaces that are in best agreement with given experimental data.
