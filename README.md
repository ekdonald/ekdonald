## About Me

I'm a Quantitative Analyst passionate about (Credit) Risk Modelling and Management.


## My Projects

#### Risk Modelling

- [Credit Risk Modelling: Probability of Default](https://github.com/ekdonald/Credit-Risk-with-GLMs-Scorecards.git): Summary of the most important points to consider when developing scorecards; Probability of Default Model Development with Generalized Linear Models, and Machine Learning. Development of scorecard.
  
- [Credit risk modeling](https://github.com/ekdonald/Credit-Risk-Modelling.git): Credit risk modeling project, the goal is to explore the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, and XGBoost to model and assess risks within a dataset. The primary objective is to investigate whether these algorithms can effectively analyze the data and provide insights into various types of risks.

#### Scientific packages

- [Dark Matter and Reheating Tools](https://github.com/ekdonald/DMandReheatingTools.git): A python package for studying all scenarios of reheating in the early universe with decaying/scattering inflaton and evaporating black hole. Also, allows compute the relic abundance of dark matter produced by the evaporating PBH. Inflaton decays into Standard Model only. 

- [Reheating Tools](https://github.com/ekdonald/ReheatingPyTools.git): A python package providing the solution of the Friedmann - Boltzmann equations for Primordial Black Holes + Inflaton + SM radiation + BSM Models. Allows to study different reheating scenarios in the universe post stochastic inflation and pre radiation domination. 

- [Superpy for munuSSM](https://github.com/ekdonald/Superpy4munuSSM.git): Bayesian Sampling, for exploring regions of susy mathematical models' parameter spaces that are in best agreement with given experimental data.
